## Feature backlog (later)

| Idea | Why / benefit | Priority (H/M/L) | Notes |
|------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| User accounts | Persist “My Shows” across devices; personal calendar URL | M | Requires auth + backend |
| Upcoming episodes list in app | See next 2 weeks without opening calendar | H | Good UX |
| Separate calendar feed per show | Subscribe to one show only | L | |
| Dark/light theme toggle | Preference | L | |
| Publish app publicly | Let others use it (multi-tenant or shareable) | M | See BRAINSTORM |
| Notifications (e.g. “new episode tomorrow”) | Email or push | L | |
| Show posters / images in list | Prettier UI | L | |
| Filter by network or genre | Power users | L | |
| Export “My Shows” as list | Backup or share list | L | |

_Add more rows as you think of ideas._
