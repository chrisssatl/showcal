# TV Show Calendar — Brainstorm

**Project:** Web app to track favorite/current TV shows and subscribe to a calendar of new episode air dates  
**Started:** February 2, 2025  
**Target launch:** ~1 week  
**Audience:** You (personal use now); may publish publicly later  

---

## Part 1: Ideas & Discovery

### Core idea (locked in)

- **Select** your favorite / current TV shows
- **Subscribe** to a calendar (e.g. Apple Calendar, Google Calendar) that shows **new episode air dates**
- Personal use first; design so it can be published later

### Open questions to brainstorm

| Topic | Questions / ideas |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Shows** | Add by name search? By pasting a list? Save “my shows” in browser only, or account later? |
| **Calendar** | One feed for all shows, or separate feeds per show? How far ahead do we show episodes (e.g. next 3 months)? |
| **Data** | Where do air dates come from? (TV API — see SCOPE.md) |
| **UX** | Do you want a simple list of “My Shows” + one “Subscribe” link? Or a dashboard with upcoming episodes? |
| **Publishing later** | Multi-user = accounts, or shareable “view-only” links? Keep it single-user and share the concept? |

## Part 3: High-level scope (from brainstorm)

- **Must-have (Phase 1):** Pick shows → get a calendar subscription URL (see SCOPE.md for details)
- **Nice-to-have / later:** See FUTURE_PLANNING.md
- **Out of scope for v1:** User accounts, public discovery, payments
